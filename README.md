# Personal Web Page
Just a personal web page built with <b>React</b>, <b>SCSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b> 
and little bit of love.
 
Provides information about me and my coding skills by showcasing few small projects:

- <b>Mousewheel checker</b><br>
    A small utility for checking my broken mouse wheel. <br>
    Just move it and watch the mouse reacting to it.<br>
    
- <b>Calculator</b><br>
    A simple calculator to do your maths. <br>
    You should know what to do with it.

- <b>Gallery</b><br>
    Check out those nice pictures of animals. <br>
   

- <b>Snake game</b><br>
    Just eat those red cubes and grow your snake.<br>
